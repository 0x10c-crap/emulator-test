DCPU-16 Emulator Test
=====================

This test program will help you learn more about your emulator and determine if it is accurate.  The test explains itself as you run it.  Some parts of the test are automated, but most require manual input from the user.

The test.bin file in the root of the repository is a big-endian pre-assembled test program.
